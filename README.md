# Advent-of-Code-2021

> My attempt to do some of the coding problems from the 2021 Advent of Code

I'm only a freshman in computer science so we'll see how far I'll be able to get :)

I'll be using `Python` to the solve the problems within a `Jupyter Notebook` (*makes it easier by having the problem prompt/instructions in the same file as the code*)
